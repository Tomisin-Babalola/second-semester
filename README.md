# My solution to the second semester project

## Project Description.
Here, I have my solution for question number 2 of the given second semester project: Setup a custom counter hook with increment, decrement, reset, setValue functions with a valid UI and Implement a combination of states with a useReducer that implements a counter with the four evident features in the custom hook -  increment, decrement, reset, setValue. Implement a page for the custom hook, useReducer, 404, and a page to test error boundary and good SEO.
